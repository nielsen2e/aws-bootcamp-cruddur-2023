# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing
Distributed tracing is a technique used in software engineering to track and analyze the flow of requests through complex distributed systems. A distributed system is one in which multiple independent components, such as microservices, interact with each other to accomplish a common goal.

In a distributed tracing system, each request is assigned a unique identifier, and this identifier is passed along with the request as it flows through the various components of the system. Each component then logs information about the request and its processing, including any errors or delays encountered, and passes this information along to the next component in the chain.

The result is a trace that shows the complete path of the request through the system, including all the individual components it passed through and the time it spent at each one. This information can be used to identify performance bottlenecks, diagnose errors, and optimize the overall performance of the system.

Distributed tracing is particularly useful in modern, cloud-based environments where applications are composed of many small, interconnected components. By providing visibility into the interactions between these components, distributed tracing helps developers and operators to quickly pinpoint and resolve issues, leading to improved system reliability and faster time-to-resolution.

## HoneyComb
Honeycomb is a cloud-based observability and monitoring tool that helps software teams gain insights into the behavior of their applications and systems. It is designed to provide high-fidelity, real-time visibility into distributed systems, allowing users to quickly identify and diagnose issues.

At its core, Honeycomb uses a distributed tracing approach to collect data about application requests as they move through a system. This data is then combined with other sources of information, such as metrics and logs, to provide a complete picture of system behavior.

One of the key features of Honeycomb is its query language, which allows users to slice and dice their data in a variety of ways, enabling them to explore complex system behaviors and identify patterns that might be missed using other monitoring tools. The query language is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with features such as autocomplete and built-in functions to simplify the process of constructing queries.
